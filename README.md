# About the Project
The project involves early detection of diseases and can be used in healthcare sector. The project combines machine learning, deep learning and data analysis to create a robust disease detection system.

# Key Features
1. Machine Learning Algorithms: the project uses deep learning methods to analyze medical data and identify different patterns associated with different diseases. For this project we have used ResNet model to train the data. ResNet, MnasNet and CSPDarkNet gave the highest accuracy while training the model.

2. User Friendly Interface: the project is deployed on streamlit and creates a user friendly interface to deal with input and output data.
